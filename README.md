# To-Do-list
Hello everyone, this is my first ejs and first backend coding i have'nt made any backend yet but as iam increasing my knowledge and learning backend development i will upload more codes here.
In this code i have made a to-do list app in which you can write your daily house works and as well as office work and if you have completed your task you can make a tick beside it.
thank you for reading this be my supporter and keep supporting me.
