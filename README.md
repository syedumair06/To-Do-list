# To-Do-list
Hello everyone, this is my first ejs project as well as first backend coding. I have'nt made any backend website yet but as iam increasing my knowledge and learning backend development i will try to make more interesting websapps and websites which contain front-end and as well as backend.
In this code i have made a to-do list website in which you can add your daily house works and as well as office works and if you have completed your task you can make a tick beside it.
Thank you for reading this be my supporter and keep supporting me.
